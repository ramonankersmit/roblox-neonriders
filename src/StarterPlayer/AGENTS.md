# Agent instructions for `src/StarterPlayer`

- Keep client scripts inside the Roblox-standard subfolders (e.g. `StarterPlayerScripts`).
- Preserve `.client.lua` suffixes for LocalScripts so that Rojo exports them correctly.
- Avoid heavy server logic here; limit to player-specific input and camera control.
