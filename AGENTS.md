# Agent instructions for `roblox-neonriders`

- This repository mirrors a Roblox experience using Rojo. Preserve the existing directory layout and file naming because it maps directly to Roblox services.
- Code is written in Luau. Prefer tabs for indentation (Roblox Studio default) and keep statement layout similar to existing files.
- When adding configuration or documentation, keep comments in English or Dutch as appropriate for surrounding content.
- Avoid introducing external tooling without confirming it can run inside Roblox Studio.
